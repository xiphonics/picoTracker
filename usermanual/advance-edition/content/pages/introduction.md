Welcome to the picoTracker Advance, a small, portable music making device based on the tracker workflow.

But what is a "tracker"?

Trackers are music production applications that started life on 16bit home computers such as the legendary Amiga 500. 

Trackers later evolved to also run on devices such as the Gameboy as popularised by LSDJ and this then inspired the LittleGPTracker (LGPT) which was designed to run on portable Linux-based gaming handheld devices. LGPT then served as the starting point for the firmware for the picoTracker, though it has now substantially diverged from those roots, being customised for the specific hardware of the picoTracker Advance and gaining many new features and improvements.

## Overview

picoTracker Advance is the evolution of the original picoTracker — a portable music instrument built around the classical tracker interface. It currently supports eight stereo channels, with per-step assignable sample and MIDI instruments. The new hardware is designed to enable new creative possibilities as the firmware continues to evolve.

* 16GB SD Card with sample projects, samples and themes
