## Introduction

The Project Pool is the sample browser for the samples that belong to the current project. It uses the same browser layout as the Sample Import view, but it shows the project sample pool directory instead of the global sample library.

## Accessing the Project Pool

1. Open the Sample Browser from the Project screen (select **Sample Pool** and press `ENTER`).

## Using the Project Pool

*   **Navigate:** Use the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys to move through the list.
*   **Preview:** Hold `PLAY` to audition the selected sample.
*   **Edit:** Select **Edit** and press `ENTER` to open the Sample Editor.
*   **Remove:** Select **Remove** and press `ENTER` to delete the sample from the project pool.
*   **Return:** Press `NAV` + `LEFT` to return to the previous screen.

Samples appear here after you import them into the project. The pool is stored with the project, so loading a different project will show its own pool.
