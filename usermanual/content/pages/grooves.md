The groove screen is located on top of the phrase screen. Groove lets you rock some swing to bust funky beats.

To grasp groove you must first you must know what a tick is, and a tick is simply a constant measurement of time. By default, every row of a phrase (aka step) gets 6 ticks, that's why you see two sixes when you go to the groove screen. But say you change the first 6 to a 1. Now, every other step lasts for 1 tick (which is shorter than 6 ticks).

To get a handle on this, try a groove of 1/F and watch the play arrow in a phrase. You'll notice the play arrow hanging around on the odd steps longer than the even ones. Then try a groove of 1/1/F and go back to the phrase screen. You'll see the play arrow hanging on every third step. Once you grasp how the groove screen effects the play arrow, you can move to more subtle values or keep the beat way freaked out!

In the groove screen there is no copy paste (yet) but the following actions are available:

- `[EDIT]`: Adds a new step if not existing
- `[EDIT]+[Left/Right]`: modifies current step value
- `[ENTER]+[Arrows]`: modifies current edited groove
- `[EDIT]+[ENTER]`: Clear current step

The GRV command (which is only active in the phrase screen) selects the current groove.
