Songs are made up of chains. Each hex number on the song screen grid is a chain. You can navigate to any of those chains by putting your cursor on a chain number and hitting `NAV`+`RIGHT`.

### Screen elements

* The top of the song screen displays if you are in SONG or LIVE mode (toggle with `EDIT`+`LEFT`/`RIGHT`) and the name of the project that is currently open.

* At the bottom of the screen are the channel playback visualiser boxes. Each box correlates with the above column in the song grid. When a step is triggered in one of the columns, the note value of that trigger is displayed in the play-time visualizer.

* On the top right of the song screen we have play-time statistics. First there is the clipping indicator which displays “----” when your volume levels are ok and “clip” when you've cleared the headroom and are chopping off the top of your samples. The bottom row of the play-time statistics is the amount of time which has passed since you pressed Play.

### Controls

* You can toggle between "SONG" or "LIVE" mode with `EDIT`+`LEFT`/`RIGHT`

* You can navigate through the grid of chains using `UP`/`DOWN`/`LEFT`/`RIGHT` 

* You can jump the cursor to the next/previous chain in a column by pressing ``NAV`+`DOWN`/`UP`

* See the [Controls & Moves reference](keypadcombos.html) for a list of all the controls you can use for editing the chains grid on the song screen.

### Solo and Mute

You can solo and mute specific channels on the song screen using the following key combos:

* `NAV`+`EDIT`: Toggles mute/unmute of cursor channel
    * if `NAV` is released before `EDIT`, channel stays mutes
    * if `EDIT` is released before `NAV`, channel goes back to original state
* `NAV`+`ENTER`: Solo cursor channel
    * if `NAV` is released before `ENTER`, channel stays solo'ed
    * if `ENTER` is released before `NAV`, all channel go back to original state
* `ALT`+`NAV`: restore full playback on all channels
* `NAV`+`ENTER`,`NAV`+`EDIT` can be used in conjunction with selections. 
    * if a selection is present the toggle mute/solo action is done on all channels present in the selection

### Playback Modes

As mentioned above, the Song screen can be either in *song* or *live* mode. The controls in each mode differ slightly. You can switch between the modes using `ENTER`+`LEFT`/`RIGHT` while on the Song screen. 

#### Song Mode

In the song mode `Play` starts and stops song playback from the currently highlighted row of the chain grid. If one of the rows channel is marked `--`, that channel will be ignored entirely for the rest of the playback session (until playback is stopped). 

#### Live Mode

In Live mode `Play` queues from the currently highlighted channel step.
* The Queued item will be played as soon as the playing chain on the selected channel reaches its last step. 
* If there is no playing chain step on the selected channel, the next song chain that reaches its last step will trigger playback. 
* Queued chains are shown with a blinking `>`.
* Pressing `Play` a second time will queue the chain using "immediate" mode. 
* The queued item will be played as soon as the playing phrase on its channel reaches the last step. 
* Immediate mode Queued items are shown with a fast blinking `>`.

`ALT`+`PLAY` will queue all channel steps on the current row.
