## Accessing the Theme Settings

To access the Theme Settings screen, select the "Theme settings" option on the Device screen. You can return to the Device screen at any time by pressing the **NAV+LEFT** key combination.

## Font

The font used for the picoTracker user interface. You can choose between:
* **standard** - The default font
* **bold** - A bolder, more prominent font

When you change the font, the entire interface will update immediately to reflect your choice.

## Color Themes

The picoTracker allows you to customize the color scheme of the interface. Each color is represented as a hexadecimal RGB value (e.g., FFFFFF for white). You can modify any of the following colors:

| Name | Default | Use |
| ---- | ------- | --- |
| Foreground | ADADAD | Normal text and UI elements |
| Background | 0F0F0F | Background color on all screens |
| Highlight1 | 846F94 | Primary highlight color, used for row counts in song screen |
| Highlight2 | 6B316B | Secondary highlight color, used for inverted highlights like screen labels |
| Console | FF00FF | Console text color |
| Cursor | 776B56 | Cursor color |

| MajorBeat | 555555 | Major beat (quarter note) indicators in the Phrase view|

Note: Row, Row2 are used to mark every block of 4 rows in the each of the "grid views", currently this is a user setting.

## Color Swatches

Next to each color setting, a small color swatch is displayed to show you the current color. This makes it easier to visualize your changes as you adjust the colors.

## Saving Changes

All changes to the theme settings are automatically saved to the SD card as you make them. This ensures your customized theme will be preserved even when you power off the picoTracker.

## Tips for Creating Custom Themes

* Be **VERY** careful when changing the foreground and background colors to not use the same or very similar color for both! 
* Create themes with good contrast between text and background colors for better readability
* Consider using complementary colors for highlights to make important elements stand out
* If you're performing in low-light conditions, consider using darker background colors to reduce screen glare
* For better visibility in bright environments, use higher contrast between foreground and background colors
