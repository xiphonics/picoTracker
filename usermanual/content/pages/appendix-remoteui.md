title: picoTracker Remote User Interface Protocol
template: page
---

## Overview

The Remote UI protocol is a communication mechanism that allows rendering the picoTracker's user interface over a USB serial connection. It enables a remote client to:

* Receive UI rendering commands
* (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) Send button input events back to the device

## Command Structure

### Command Marker

Every command starts with a fixed marker: `0xFE` (REMOTE_UI_CMD_MARKER). This allows clients to verify the start of a valid command.

**Note:** That the use of this value as a marker to start commands means that the characters 0xFE and 0xFF from the extended ASCII range are not allowed in the protocols command parameter values.


### Command Types

Note: `ASCII_SPACE_OFFSET = 0xF`


1. TEXT_CMD (0x2): Draw a character

Parameters:

* Character to draw
* X position (offset by ASCII_SPACE_OFFSET)
* Y position (offset by ASCII_SPACE_OFFSET)
* Invert flag (0 for normal, 0x7F for inverted)

2. `CLEAR_CMD (0x3)`: Clear screen

Parameters:

* Background color in RGB565 format

3. SETCOLOR_CMD (0x4): Set foreground color

Parameters:

* Color in RGB565 format

4. SETFONT_CMD (0x5)

Parameters:

* Font index  (offset by ASCII_SPACE_OFFSET)

Currently the only available fonts are:

 | Index | Font   
 | ----- | -----
 | 0     | Hourglass
 | 1     | You Squared



### RGB565 Format

RGB565 is a 16-bit color format used for drawing text and UI. It is composed of three 5-bit values for the red, green and blue components of the color. Example code for efficient conversion between RGB565 and RGB888 can be found from the official picoTracker client Flutter code:

```dart
r: (_byteBuffer[0] * 527 + 23) >> 5, // Red component
g: (_byteBuffer[1] * 259 + 33) >> 6, // Green component
b: (_byteBuffer[2] * 527 + 23) >> 5, // Blue component
```

### Example Transmission Flow

To give a concrete example, below is a simple example of how a command in the picoTracker firmware istransmitted over USB serial:

```cpp

// Drawing a character 'A' at position (2,3), not inverted
remoteUIBuffer[0] = 0xFE;        // Command marker
remoteUIBuffer[1] = DRAW_CMD;    // Draw command
remoteUIBuffer[2] = 'A';         // Character
remoteUIBuffer[3] = 34;          // X position (2 + 32)
remoteUIBuffer[4] = 35;          // Y position (3 + 32)
remoteUIBuffer[5] = 32;          // Not inverted
sendToUSBCDC(remoteUIBuffer, 6);
```

### Input Commands

Clients are also able to send input events to the picoTracker. As for output commands, the input commands are prefixed by sending the REMOTE_UI_CMD_MARKER byte.

The events currently supported are:

1. FULL_REFRESH_CMD (0x2): Request sending all the current screen and current font

Parameters:

* None


### Limitations

* Input events other than FULL_REFRESH_CMD are not yet implemented.

### Client Implementation Guidelines

1. Look for REMOTE_UI_CMD_MARKER (0xFD)
1. Verify command type
1. Subtract 32 from positional/color values
1. Handle potential transmission errors
1. Implement appropriate rendering based on received commands
