The device screen allows you to manage settings for the picoTracker device hardware itself.

**Note:** the picoTracker saves its device settings to the SDCard so if you replace the sdcard in your picoTracker, the device configuration will reset to factory defaults.

    * None
    * TRS
    * USB
    * TRS+USB
- **MIDI sync:** Enable/disable MIDI clock sync messages being sent by the picoTracker.

## Line Out Mode (1st Edition RP2040 model only)

On the first edition picoTracker, the audio output can be set to one of 3 amplification levels to make the audio level output more useful for Line Level output or Headphone output. The 3 possible settings are: 
* `HP Low`
* `HP High`
* `Line Level`

**NOTE: A reboot of the picoTracker is required to apply the newly changed audio output level!** 

**PLEASE exercise caution when using earphones or headphones!*

## Remote UI

This setting enables or disables sending commands to a computer attached via USB to the picoTracker running a "remote UI" application that can mirror the display from the picoTracker.

The [official picoTracker remote UI web application is available ](https://ui.xiphonics.com), it works only with Chromium based browsers.

## Theme Settings

The Theme Settings screen allows you to customize the appearance of the picoTracker interface, including fonts and colors. To access the Theme Settings screen, select the "Theme settings" option on the Device screen.

See the [Theme Settings](theme.html) chapter for more details.

## Updating Firmware

The picoTracker firmware can be easily updated by powering the picoTracker via a USB connected to a PC. Select `Update firmware`. This will reboot the device into *BOOTSEL* mode, and you'll see the picoTracker show up as a USB mass storage device on the connected computer. At that point, just copy the UF2 firmware file into the USB device as you would with a USB stick or USB drive. 

Once copying (flashing) of the new firmware is completed, the picoTracker will automatically reboot and be running the newly installed firmware.
