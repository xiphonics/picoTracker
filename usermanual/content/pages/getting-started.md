## Navigation

The picoTracker user interface is made up of a series of screens, which are layed out in a "map" which is represented at the bottom right of each screen with a single letter representing each screen, along with highlighting with a different color which screen is currently being displayed on screen. For example below you can see the screen map with the Song screen (S) shown as being currently displayed.


### Screen Map

On bootup, the picoTracker will start on the Song screen of the last previously opened project.

The picoTrackers keypad layout resembles a typical old console game controller.

You can navigate (aka move) between screens using the `[NAV]+[UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT]` keys.

To get to the chain screen, you need to have your cursor on a chain in the song. To get to the phrase screen, you need to have your cursor on a pattern in the chain screen.

### Playback Modes and Controls

When you are on the Song screen, there are two modes for playback, Song Mode and Live Mode. The controls in each mode differ slightly.

You can switch between the modes by hitting `[ENTER]+[LEFT/RIGHT]` keys in the Song screen.

### File Browser 

When selecting a sample wav file or project file you enter the file browser view.

When in the Project File Browser view, use the `[UP]` and `[DOWN]` arrow keys to navigate through the list of project available and press [EDIT] to open the currently selected (highlighted) a project. 

When in the wave sample File Browser,  use the `[UP]` and `[DOWN]` arrow keys to navigate through the list of available sample files and subdirectories, subdirectories are indciated with a `/` prefix. Press [EDIT] to enter a subdirectory, you can go back to the parent directory by navigating to the `/..` entery and pressing [ENTER]. Press [PLAY] to audition the currently selected sample wave file. To import the currently selected wave file press [ALT]+[PLAY]. At any time, you can return to the instrument screen from the sample file browser by pressing [NAV]+[LEFT].


## Shutdown
You can just unplug the machine any time you want other than when saving a project (which is an extremely brief moment). **Save your work first if you care about it.**
