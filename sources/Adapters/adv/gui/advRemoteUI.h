// The Remote UI protocol consists of sending ASCII messages over the USB serial
// connection to a client to render the UI shown by the picotracker and then
// listening for incoming button input events sent by the remote client.
//
// The messages consist of the types in the RemoteUICommand enum below and
// essentially just relay the existing draw, clear and setcolor commands that
// already exist in picTrackerGUIWidowImp.cpp
//
// Note that to avoid issues with non-printing chars being mishandled by either
// the pico SDK or client serial port drivers, most command param "values" have
// been attempted to be offset to push them into the printable char range.
//
// Remote UI clients should pay careful attention to using the
// REMOTE_UI_CMD_MARKER and also verify the expected byte count length of each
// command received to check for any transmission errors.
