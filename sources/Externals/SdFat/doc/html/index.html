<h1><a class="anchor" id="Warn"></a>
Warnings for SdFat V2</h1>
<p>This is a major new version of SdFat. It is mostly backward compatible with SdFat Version 1 for FAT16/FAT32 cards.</p>
<p>You should edit <a class="el" href="_sd_fat_config_8h.html" title="configuration definitions">SdFatConfig.h</a> to select features. The default version of <a class="el" href="_sd_fat_config_8h.html" title="configuration definitions">SdFatConfig.h</a> is suitable for UNO and other small AVR boards.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Intro"></a>
Introduction</h1>
<p>The Arduino SdFat library supports FAT16, FAT32, and exFAT file systems on Standard SD, SDHC, and SDXC cards.</p>
<p>In SdFat version 1, SdFat and File are the main classes.</p>
<p>In SdFat version 2, SdFat and File are defined by typedefs in terms of the following classes.</p>
<p>The file system classes in the SdFat library are <a class="el" href="class_sd_fat32.html" title="SD file system class for FAT volumes.">SdFat32</a>, <a class="el" href="class_sd_ex_fat.html" title="SD file system class for exFAT volumes.">SdExFat</a>, and <a class="el" href="class_sd_fs.html" title="SD file system class for FAT16, FAT32, and exFAT volumes.">SdFs</a>. <a class="el" href="class_sd_fat32.html" title="SD file system class for FAT volumes.">SdFat32</a> supports FAT16 and FAT32. <a class="el" href="class_sd_ex_fat.html" title="SD file system class for exFAT volumes.">SdExFat</a> supports exFAT, <a class="el" href="class_sd_fs.html" title="SD file system class for FAT16, FAT32, and exFAT volumes.">SdFs</a> supports FAT16, FAT32, and exFAT.</p>
<p>The corresponding file classes are <a class="el" href="class_file32.html" title="FAT16/FAT32 file with Arduino Stream.">File32</a>, <a class="el" href="class_ex_file.html" title="exFAT file with Arduino Stream.">ExFile</a>, and <a class="el" href="class_fs_file.html" title="FsBaseFile file with Arduino Stream.">FsFile</a>.</p>
<p>The types for SdFat and File are defined in <a class="el" href="_sd_fat_config_8h.html" title="configuration definitions">SdFatConfig.h</a>. This version uses FAT16/FAT32 for small AVR boards and FAT16/FAT32/exFAT for all other boards.</p>

</div><!-- fragment --><p>It is possible to use option three, support or FAT16/FAT32 and exFat on an Uno or other AVR board with 32KB flash and 2KB SRAM but memory will be very limited.</p>
<p>Uno memory use for a simple data logger is:</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>&zwj;option 1, FAT16/FAT32, 11902 bytes of flash and 855 bytes of SRAM.</p>
<p>option 2, exFAT, 14942 bytes of flash and 895 bytes of SRAM.</p>
<p>option 3, FAT16/FAT32 and exFAT, 21834 bytes of flash and 908 bytes of SRAM. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please read documentation under the above classes tab for more information.</p>
<p>A number of example are provided in the SdFat/examples folder. These were developed to test SdFat and illustrate its use.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="exFAT"></a>
exFAT Features</h1>
<p>exFAT has many features not available in FAT16/FAT32.</p>
<p>Files larger than 4GiB, 64-bit file size and file position.</p>
<p>Free space allocation performance improved by using a free space bitmap.</p>
<p>Removal of the physical "." and ".." directory entries that appear in FAT16/FAT32 subdirectories.</p>
<p>Better support for large flash pages with boundary alignment offsets for the FAT table and data region.</p>
<p>exFAT files have two separate 64-bit length fields. The DataLength field indicate how much space is allocate to the file. The ValidDataLength field indicates how much actual data has been written to the file.</p>
<p>An exFAT file can be contiguous with pre-allocate clusters and bypass the use of the FAT table. In this case the contiguous flag is set in the directory entry. This allows an entire file to be written as one large multi-block write.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="SDPath"></a>
Paths and Working Directories</h1>
<p>Relative paths in SdFat are resolved in a manner similar to Windows.</p>
<p>Each instance of <a class="el" href="class_sd_fat32.html" title="SD file system class for FAT volumes.">SdFat32</a>, <a class="el" href="class_sd_ex_fat.html" title="SD file system class for exFAT volumes.">SdExFat</a>, and <a class="el" href="class_sd_fs.html" title="SD file system class for FAT16, FAT32, and exFAT volumes.">SdFs</a> has a current directory. This directory is called the volume working directory, vwd. Initially this directory is the root directory for the volume.</p>
<p>The volume working directory is changed by calling the chdir(path).</p>
<p>The call sd.chdir("/2014") will change the volume working directory for sd to "/2014", assuming "/2014" exists.</p>
<p>Relative paths for member functions are resolved by starting at the volume working directory.</p>
<p>For example, the call sd.mkdir("April") will create the directory "/2014/April" assuming the volume working directory is "/2014".</p>
<p>There is current working directory, cwd, that is used to resolve paths for file.open() calls.</p>
<p>For a single SD card, the current working directory is always the volume working directory for that card.</p>
<p>For multiple SD cards the current working directory is set to the volume working directory of a card by calling the chvol() member function. The chvol() call is like the Windows &lt;drive letter&gt;: command.</p>
<p>The call sd2.chvol() will set the current working directory to the volume working directory for sd2.</p>
<p>If the volume working directory for sd2 is "/music" the call</p>
<p>file.open("BigBand.wav", O_READ);</p>
<p>will open "/music/BigBand.wav" on sd2.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Install"></a>
Installation</h1>
<p>You must manually install SdFat by renaming the download folder SdFat and copy the SdFat folder to the Arduino libraries folder in your sketchbook folder.</p>
<p>It will be necessary to unzip and rename the folder if you download a zip file from GitHub.</p>
<p>See the Manual installation section of this guide.</p>
<p><a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries">http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries</a></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="SDconfig"></a>
SdFat Configuration</h1>
<p>Several configuration options may be changed by editing the <a class="el" href="_sd_fat_config_8h.html" title="configuration definitions">SdFatConfig.h</a> file in the SdFat/src folder.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the key options.</p>
<p>If the symbol ENABLE_DEDICATED_SPI is nonzero, multi-block SD I/O may be used for better performance. The SPI bus may not be shared with other devices in this mode.</p>
<p>The symbol SPI_DRIVER_SELECT is used to select the SPI driver.</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>&zwj;If the symbol SPI_DRIVER_SELECT is:</p>
<p>0 - An optimized custom SPI driver is used if it exists else the standard library driver is used.</p>
<p>1 - The standard library driver is always used.</p>
<p>2 - The software SPI driver is always used.</p>
<p>3 - An external SPI driver derived from <a class="el" href="class_sd_spi_base_class.html" title="Base class for external SPI drivers.">SdSpiBaseClass</a> is always used. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To enable SD card CRC checking in SPI mode set USE_SD_CRC nonzero.</p>
<p>See <a class="el" href="_sd_fat_config_8h.html" title="configuration definitions">SdFatConfig.h</a> for other options.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Hardware"></a>
Hardware Configuration</h1>
<p>The hardware interface to the SD card should not use a resistor based level shifter. Resistor based level shifters results in signal rise times that are too slow for many newer SD cards.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="HowTo"></a>
How to format SD Cards</h1>
<p>The best way to restore an SD card's format on a PC or Mac is to use SDFormatter which can be downloaded from:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sdcard.org/downloads">http://www.sdcard.org/downloads</a></p>
<p>A formatter program, SdFormatter.ino, is included in the SdFat/examples/SdFormatter directory. This program attempts to emulate SD Association's SDFormatter.</p>
<p>SDFormatter aligns flash erase boundaries with file system structures which reduces write latency and file system overhead.</p>
<p>The PC/Mac SDFormatter does not have an option for FAT type so it may format very small cards as FAT12. Use the SdFormatter example to force FAT16 formatting of small cards.</p>
<p>Do not format the SD card with an OS utility, OS utilities do not format SD cards in conformance with the SD standard.</p>
<p>You should use a freshly formatted SD card for best performance. FAT file systems become slower if many files have been created and deleted. This is because the directory entry for a deleted file is marked as deleted, but is not deleted. When a new file is created, these entries must be scanned before creating the file. Also files can become fragmented which causes reads and writes to be slower.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="ExampleFiles"></a>
