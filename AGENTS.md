# Gemini Code Assistant Context

This document provides context for the Gemini code assistant to understand the
picoTracker project.

## Project Overview

picoTracker is a low-cost, open-source, and DIY hardware music tracker. The
firmware is a modified version of LittleGPTracker, retaining most of its
functionality while adding custom modifications.

The project is written in C++20 and uses CMake for building. It has a modular
architecture, with different components separated into directories like
`Application`, `Services`, `System`, and `UIFramework`.

The codebase is cross platform, supporting firmware for both the original RP2040
baed "pico" model and the STM32H7 based "Advance" (adv) model. The platform
specific code for each lives under the respective Adaptors sub directories.

**Key Technologies:**

- **C++20:** The primary programming language.
- **CMake:** The build system used to compile the project.
- **Raspberry Pi Pico SDK:** Used for building the firmware for the Pico.
- **FreeRTOS:** Used for the "picoTracker Advance" board.
- **ETL (Embedded Template Library):** A C++ template library for embedded
  systems.
- **Sdfat:** A generic FAT file system module for the picoTracker pico model.
- **FatFs:** A generic FAT file system module for the picoTracker Advance (adv)
  model.
- **tinyusb:** An open-source USB host/device stack.
- **LVGL:** A lightweight, embedded graphics library (mentioned but might not be
  in use).

## Building and Running

The project is built using CMake. Here are the general steps to build the
project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/democloid/picoTracker
   cd picoTracker
   ```

2. **Initialize submodules:**
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. **Create a build directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

4. **Run CMake:**
   ```bash
   PICO_SDK_PATH=../sources/Externals/pico-sdk cmake ../sources
   ```

5. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

**To create a debug build:**

```bash
PICO_SDK_PATH=../sources/Externals/pico-sdk cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DPICO_DEOPTIMIZED_DEBUG=1 ../sources/
```

## Development Conventions

- **Coding Style:** The project follows the
  [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
  Code formatting is enforced by `clang-format`. Before submitting a pull
  request, run `clang-format` to ensure your code adheres to the style guide.
- **`printf` usage:** The `printf` family of functions should not be used.
  Instead, use the `nanoprintf` library functions found in `nanoprintf.h`. For
  debug logging, use the `Trace` class.
- **Debugging:** The recommended way to debug is by using a `picoProbe` and
  `OpenOCD`. The `docs/DEV.md` file provides detailed instructions on how to set
  up a debugging environment.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions are used for continuous integration, which includes a
  `clang-format` check and a build of the firmware.
